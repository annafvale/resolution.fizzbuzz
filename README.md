# Resolution FizzBuzz 

This is JavaScript code, using knowledge acquired in Java as a basis.

I followed the logic presented, whose context asked to solve four rules, basically described as "Fizzbuzz". Therefore, if a number is 
divisible by 3, it prints "Buzz". If it is divisible by 5, it prints "Fizz", if it is divisible by both, it prints "Fizzbuzz", however, if
it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it prints it itself. Uses "%" to check whether a number is divisible by another. For
example: "i % 3 === 0", checks if "i" is divisible by 3 without leaving a remainder. If it is, it prints "Buzz". I followed these conditions 
for each number from 1 to 100.

Once I understood what needed to be resolved, I thought about how I would organize the logic so I could start coding. However, I did a lot
of research to make sure that the way I was describing was correct. Because I always try to deliver tasks in a clear and organized way,
which makes me do a lot of research so that I have a base path to improve, so my priority was to leave it in a readable and tested way, so
that I can document it correctly, no redundancies.

I hope to learn more about this environment and add to the team, thank you.
